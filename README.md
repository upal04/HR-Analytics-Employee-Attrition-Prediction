HR Analytics – Predict Employee Attrition
📌 Project Overview

Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations, leading to increased hiring costs, productivity loss, and decreased morale.
This project uses data analytics and machine learning to identify the main causes of employee resignation and predict future attrition.

🎯 Objectives

Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to uncover attrition trends.

Build classification models (Logistic Regression & Decision Tree) to predict attrition.

Use SHAP values for model interpretability and feature importance.

Develop an interactive Power BI Dashboard for HR managers.

Provide data-driven suggestions to reduce attrition.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python → Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SHAP

Power BI → Dashboard & data visualization

Jupyter Notebook → Data analysis and model building

📊 Steps Performed

Data Preprocessing

Cleaned dataset, handled missing values, and encoded categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Department-wise attrition

Salary bands & promotions

Age and tenure distribution

Model Building

Logistic Regression → Accuracy ~86%

Decision Tree → Good interpretability

Confusion matrix and classification reports evaluated performance

Explainability (SHAP Analysis)

Identified top factors influencing attrition (Job Role, Salary, Tenure).

Visualization

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard showing attrition by department, salary, and demographics.

Attrition Prevention Suggestions

Improve career growth opportunities

Conduct competitive salary reviews

Implement work-life balance programs

Train managers in effective leadership
